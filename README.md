## Thesis title: Generation and classification of passwords using Markov models

Passwords are nowadays the main way to restrict access to online content.
When choosing a password, computer users rarely think about the level of security
they provide. Commercial password classification tools will often force the user
to create a password that is hard to remember or in most cases a weak password.
Such tools do classification based on the idea that an attacker will perform a brute
force attack, although there are much more sophisticated methods for cracking
passwords. The goal of this paper is to create a solution that will allow the user
to create a secure and easy to remember password. A classification system will be
proposed to determine the likelihood of an attacker guessing a password if using
a statistical attack based on Markov models.
